During the development of the `Custom Sidebar Icons` plugin, I drew inspiration and incorporated some code constructs from [Benature](https://github.com/Benature)'s project [obsidian-metadata-icon](https://github.com/Benature/obsidian-metadata-icon). I would like to especially thank this project and its contributors for their contributions to the open-source community, which have greatly facilitated the development of the Obsidian plugin ecosystem.
